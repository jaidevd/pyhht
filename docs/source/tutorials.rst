PyHHT Tutorials
===============

The `Hilbert Huang transform
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%E2%80%93Huang_transform>`_
(HHT) is a time series analysis technique that is
designed to handle nonlinear and nonstationary time series data. PyHHT is a
Python module based on NumPy and SciPy which implements the HHT. These
tutorials introduce HHT, the common vocabulary associated with it and the usage of the
PyHHT module itself to analyze time series data.

This series of tutorials goes through the philosophy of the Hilbert Huang
transform in detail. The first two tutorials lay the groundwork for the HHT,
providing the motivation first for the Hilbert spectral analysis and then for
the empirical mode decomposition algorithm. The third tutorial is an
introduction to the PyHHT module. You may skip the first two sections if you
are comfortable with the theory of HHT and if you want to start coding Python
applications with PyHHT.
